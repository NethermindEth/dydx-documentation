# Accounts

All of your trading activity is associated with your account which corresponds to an address.
In dYdX, accounts are also composed by subaccounts. All trading is done through a subaccount. See more on the [Accounts and Subaccounts](/concepts/trading/accounts) page.

:::info
To transfer assets in and out of the dYdX network, please see the [Deposits and Withdawals](/interaction/deposits-and-withdrawals)Â page. If using the __testnet__, please the [Faucet client](/interaction/endpoints#faucet-client) on how to request test funds.

## Account Data

An account can have multiple subaccounts. To fetch all known (with some activity) subaccounts associated with an account the account's address is required.

:::code-group

```python [Python]
response = await indexer.account.get_subaccounts(ADDRESS)
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
const response = await indexer.account.getSubaccounts(ADDRESS);
```

```rust [Rust]
let subaccounts = indexer.accounts().get_subaccounts(address).await?;
```

:::

To fetch a specific subaccount, use the account's address the the subaccount number.

:::code-group

```python [Python]
# Fetch subaccount '0' information.
response = await indexer.account.get_subaccount(ADDRESS, 0)
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
// Fetch subaccount '0' information.
const response = await indexer.account.getSubaccount(ADDRESS, 0);
```

```rust [Rust]
// Fetch subaccount '0' information.
let subaccount_resp = indexer.accounts().get_subaccount(&subaccount).await?;
```

:::

## Account Balances

Get the account balance of all assets types (currently USDC and dYdX tokens).

:::code-group

```python [Python]
response = await node.get_account_balances(ADDRESS)
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
const coins = await node.get.getAccountBalances(ADDRESS);
```

```rust [Rust]
let client = NodeClient::connect(config.node).await?;
let balance = client
    .get_account_balances(&address)
    .await?;
```

:::

The balance of a specific asset can also be fetched instead.

:::code-group

```python [Python]
# `adv4tnt` is the dYdX token (testnet) denomination.
response = await node.get_account_balance(TEST_ADDRESS, "adv4tnt") # [!code focus]
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
// `adv4tnt` is the dYdX token (testnet) denomination.
const coins = await node.get.getAccountBalance(DYDX_TEST_ADDRESS, "adv4tnt"); // [!code focus]
```

```rust [Rust]
let client = NodeClient::connect(config.node).await?; // [!code focus]
// `adv4tnt` is the dYdX token (testnet) denomination.
let balance = node // [!code focus]
    .get_account_balance(&address, &"adv4tnt".parse()?) // [!code focus]
    .await?; // [!code focus]
```
