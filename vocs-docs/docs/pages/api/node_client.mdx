# Orders

Entering, managing, and closing positions is made by placing orders. There are two types of orders: short-term orders and long-term orders.

:::note
Check the [differences](https://docs.dydx.exchange/api_integration-trading/short_term_vs_stateful) between short-term and long-term orders.
:::

An order in dYdX is a transaction that can be accepted if the order conditions are met. Therefore, before sending it, we must prepare and assemble it by setting all parameters that serve as criteria for its execution or cancellation.

## Order Parameters

:::tip
We should focus here on the low-level [parameters](https://docs.dydx.exchange/api_integration-guides/how_to_interpret_block_data_for_trades) that allow to create an order instead. I.e.: quantums, subticks per tick.

This section is currently focused on the `OrderBuilder` of the Rust client. Optimally, this will go into a separate section, or add it to the source docs, published on crates.io with a link to there here.
:::

Creating an order requires parameters (`OrderMarketParams`) associated with the traded perpetual.
These can be fetched using the optional `IndexerClient` through the `get_perpetual_market()` method.

To create an order, the `OrderBuilder` is used, a special structure with a set of convenient methods.
As minimum requirements, the user should be provide,
- the market parameters (`market`), and the Subaccount (`subaccount`) which the order will be placed under;
- the order type: options are Limit (`limit()`), Market (`market()`), among other available [types](https://help.dydx.trade/en/articles/166981-perpetual-order-types-on-dydx-chain). The order type must also have the respective:
    - side: `Buy` or `Sell`, variants of `OrderSide`;
    - price: an integer with the price in USDC, or a `BigDecimal` with decimal parts;
    - size: an integer with the order size, or a `BigDecimal` with decimal parts;
- validity of the order, set using `until()`. For short-term order this is the block height (20 blocks max validity), for long-term orders this is the timestamp (28 days max validity);
- the client ID, set by the user to identify the order. Can be any value in the `u32` range.

For more building options please refer to [`OrderBuilder`](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-clients/blob/3e8c7e1b960291b7ef273962d374d9934a5c4d33/v4-client-rs/client/src/node/order.rs#L171) and the [examples](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-clients/tree/3e8c7e1b960291b7ef273962d374d9934a5c4d33/v4-client-rs/client/examples).

Here, we create a `Buy` order for 0.1 units of `ETH-USD` at a price of 1500 USDC, with a validity of 10 blocks (~10 seconds):

```rust [main.rs]
let client_id = 123456;
let (order_id, order) = OrderBuilder::new(market, subaccount)
    .limit(OrderSide::Buy, 1500, BigDecimal::from_str("0.1")?)
    .until(current_block_height.ahead(10))
    .build(client_id)?;
```

The `OrderBuilder` upon finalization (through `build()`), returns: the order ID which uniquely identifies the order, and the order.

### Place an Order

:::tip
We can follow the structure of the [v3 docs](https://dydxprotocol.github.io/v3-teacher/?python#create-a-new-order).
Move the code snippet to some sort of tab / leave it below though tabbed as a sibling to the other languages examples.
Remove the focus of Rust here, and add the [gRPC arguments / structures fields](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-chain/blob/d2d65905a844ed607aef7850168c23844533d8ee/proto/dydxprotocol/clob/tx.proto#L78) instead.
:::

To broadcast an order to the network, `NodeClient::place_order()` is employed. The account owning the subaccount of the order, and order are required.

```rust [main.rs]
let tx_hash = client
    .place_order(&mut account, order)
    .await?;
```

### Request

:::info
gRPC URL: `dydxprotocol.clob.MsgPlaceOrder`
:::

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Account` | User's account |
| `Order` | The built order |

### Response

This returns the transaction hash if successful, or an error with the message reason returned by the server.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `TxHash` | Transaction hash |


## Cancel an Order

Unmatched and unfilled orders can be cancelled.
To cancel an order, `NodeClient::cancel_order()` is employed. The order ID returned by the `OrderBuilder` and the validity of the cancel request must be provided.

```rust [main.rs]
let tx_hash = client
    .cancel_order(&mut account, order_id, good_until)
    .await?;
```

:::note
Issuing order cancellations does not affect open positions. To close or reduce any open position, a new order must be issued with the opposite side to the position.

### Request

:::info
gRPC URL: `dydxprotocol.clob.MsgCancelOrder`
:::

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Account` | User's account |
| `OrderId` | Order ID |
| `OrderGoodUntil` | Cancellation validity block / time |

### Response

This returns the transaction hash if successful, or an error with the message reason returned by the server.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `TxHash` | Transaction hash |
