## Preparing an Order

Entering, managing, and closing positions is made by placing orders. There are two types of orders: short-term orders and long-term orders.
Here, we'll use short-term orders.

:::note
Check the [differences](https://docs.dydx.exchange/api_integration-trading/short_term_vs_stateful) between short-term and long-term orders.

An order in dYdX is actually a transaction that can be accepted into a block if the order conditions are met. Therefore, before sending it, we must prepare and assemble it by setting all parameters that serve as criteria for its execution or cancellation.

### Order Parameters

Creating an order requires parameters (`OrderMarketParams`) associated with the traded perpetual.
These can be fetched using the optional `IndexerClient` through the `get_perpetual_market()` method.

To create an order, the `OrderBuilder` is used, a special structure with a set of convenient methods.
As minimum requirements, the user should be provide,
- the market parameters (`market`), and the Subaccount (`subaccount`) which the order will be placed under;
- the order type: options are Limit (`limit()`), Market (`market()`), among other available [types](https://help.dydx.trade/en/articles/166981-perpetual-order-types-on-dydx-chain). The order type must also have the respective:
    - side: `Buy` or `Sell`, variants of `OrderSide`;
    - price: an integer with the price in USDC, or a `BigDecimal` with decimal parts;
    - size: an integer with the order size, or a `BigDecimal` with decimal parts;
- validity of the order, set using `until()`. For short-term order this is the block height (20 blocks max validity), for long-term orders this is the timestamp (28 days max validity);
- the client ID, set by the user to identify the order. Can be any value in the `u32` range.

For more building options please refer to [`OrderBuilder`](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-clients/blob/3e8c7e1b960291b7ef273962d374d9934a5c4d33/v4-client-rs/client/src/node/order.rs#L171) and the [examples](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-clients/tree/3e8c7e1b960291b7ef273962d374d9934a5c4d33/v4-client-rs/client/examples). # TODO Explain in another section.

Here, we create a `Buy` order for 0.1 units of `ETH-USD` at a price of 1500 USDC, with a validity of 10 blocks (~10 seconds):

```rust [main.rs]
let client_id = 123456;
let (order_id, order) = OrderBuilder::new(market, subaccount)
    .limit(OrderSide::Buy, 1500, BigDecimal::from_str("0.1")?)
    .until(current_block_height.ahead(10))
    .build(client_id)?;
```

The `OrderBuilder` upon finalization (through `build()`), returns: the order ID which uniquely identifies the order, and the order.

### Placing an Order

To broadcast an order to the network, `NodeClient::place_order()` is employed. The account owning the subaccount of the order, and order are required:

```rust [main.rs]
let tx_hash = client
    .place_order(&mut account, order)
    .await?;
```

This returns the transaction hash if successful, or an error with the message reason returned by the server.

### Cancelling an Order

Unmatched and unfilled orders can be cancelled.
To cancel an order, `NodeClient::cancel_order()` is employed. The order ID returned by the `OrderBuilder` and the validity of the cancel request must be provided:

```rust [main.rs]
let tx_hash = client
    .cancel_order(&mut account, order_id, good_until)
    .await?;
```

This returns the transaction hash if successful, or an error with the message reason returned by the server.

:::note
Issuing order cancellations does not affect open positions. To close or reduce any open position, a new order must be issued with the opposite side to the position.
