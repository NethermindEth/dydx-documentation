## Cancel an Order

Unmatched and unfilled orders can be cancelled.
To cancel an order, `NodeClient::cancel_order()` is employed. The order ID returned by the `OrderBuilder` and the validity of the cancel request must be provided.

```rust [main.rs]
let tx_hash = client
    .cancel_order(&mut account, order_id, good_until)
    .await?;
```

:::note
Issuing order cancellations does not affect open positions. To close or reduce any open position, a new order must be issued with the opposite side to the position.
