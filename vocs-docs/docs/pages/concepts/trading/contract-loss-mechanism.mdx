# Contract Loss Mechanisms

During periods of high volatility in the markets underlying the perpetual contracts, the value of some accounts may drop below zero before they can be liquidated.

The insurance fund is the first backstop to maintain the solvency of the system when an account has a negative balance. The account will be liquidated, and the insurance fund will take on the loss.

In the event that the insurance fund is depleted, positions with the most profit and leverage may be used to offset negative-balance accounts, in order to maintain the stability of the system.
