# Funding

Funding payments are exchanged between long and short traders to encourage the price of a perpetual contract to trade close to the price of the underlying. If the perpetual trades at a premium relative to the index, long traders will typically make payments to short traders, whereas if the perpetual trades at a discount relative to the index, short traders will typically make payments to long traders.

The payments are credited or debited at the start of each hour, and are included in the realized PnL for the position.

## Rate Calculation

The main component of the funding rate is a premium that takes into account market activity for the perpetual. It is calculated for each market, every minute (at a random point within the minute) using the formula:

```
Premium = (Max(0, IBP - Index Price) - Max(0, Index Price - IAP)) / Index Price
```

Where the impact bid (IBP) and impact ask (IAP) prices are defined as:

```
IBP = Average execution price for a market sell of the impact notional value
IAP = Average execution price for a market buy of the impact notional value
```

And the impact notional amount for a market is:

```
Impact Notional Amount = 500 USDC / Initial Margin Fraction
```

For example, for a market with a 10% initial margin fraction, the impact notional value is 5,000 USDC.

At the end of each hour, the premium component is calculated as the simple average (i.e. TWAP) of the 60 premiums calculated over the course of the last hour. In addition to the premium component, each market has a fixed interest rate component that aims to account for the difference in interest rates of the base and quote currencies. The funding rate is then:

```
Funding Rate = (Premium Component / 8) + Interest Rate Component
```

Currently, the interest rate component for all dYdX markets is `0%`. The funding rate is simply the one-hour premium for markets with no interest rate component.
