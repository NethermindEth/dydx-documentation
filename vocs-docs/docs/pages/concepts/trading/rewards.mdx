# Rewards, Fees and Parameters

Trading rewards on the dYdX Chain are designed to incentivize meaningful trading activity while preventing abuse and minimizing inflation of the governance token. Rewards are distributed to traders on a per-block basis, immediately after each successful trade.

Key principles:
- Rewards are proportional to trading fees paid and capped at 90% of a trade's net fees.
- Users see potential reward estimates before executing a trade.
- Rewards are paid in the network's governance token and distributed directly to users' wallets after each fill.
- The protocol ensures rewards distribution is deterministic, block-based, and does not encourage self-trading.
- Trading rewards for a block are capped by the total net trading fees generated that block to prevent overspending.

Rewards are distributed from a Rewards Treasury that is replenished each block. Any undistributed rewards roll over to the next block, helping reduce inflation over time.

## Protocol Parameters

The dYdX Chain defines a variety of parameters, which can be configured at Genesis or modified via governance. These control the economic behavior, security mechanisms, validator incentives, and governance processes of the chain.

### Fee Schedule
_The fee schedule is subject to adjustments by the applicable Governance Community_

The basic structure for fees have been developed to reflect the following characteristics:

1. Fees differ based on side (maker/taker)
2. Users are eligible for lower fees based on their 30 day trading volume across sub accounts and markets
3. Fees are uniform across all markets

### Bank & State
- Token transfers are enabled at launch.
- No pre-populated balances at Genesis; validator participants determine initial state.

### Slashing
- Validators must sign 20% of blocks in a 3-hour window (8192 blocks).
- Downtime leads to jail (2-hour duration), but there is no slashing for downtime by default.
- Double-signing results in slashing, jailing, and tombstoning.

### Distribution
- Community tax is set to 0%.
- Delegators can specify custom reward withdrawal addresses.

### Staking
- Maximum of 60 validators.
- Unbonding time is 30 days.
- Minimum validator commission rate is 5%.

### Governance
- Minimum proposal deposit: 10,000 governance tokens.
- At least 20% of the deposit must be submitted to initiate a vote.
- Deposit period: 1 day; voting period: 4 days.
- Proposal passes with 50% approval, 33.4% quorum, and less than 33.4% veto.
