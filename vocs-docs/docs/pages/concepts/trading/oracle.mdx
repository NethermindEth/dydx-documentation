# Oracle Prices

Oracle prices on the dYdX are aggregated market prices used to ensure accurate collateralization, trigger specific order types (like Stop-Limit and Take-Profit), and manage liquidations. These prices are a core part of the dYdX v4 open-source software and play a critical role in maintaining trading integrity.

## How Prices Are Determined

Validators on the dYdX Chain are responsible for calculating and agreeing on fair market prices. The process includes:
- Each validator continuously computing price data.
- A block proposer suggesting price updates in a new block.
- Other validators applying price-acceptance rules to verify that the suggested changes are reasonable.

Consensus ensures that only fair and stable prices are accepted, preventing manipulation or faulty data from impacting the system.

## Handling Volatility and Price Stability

To prevent extreme or sudden price changes from affecting the platform:
- Validators enforce rules that reject price updates significantly different from previous values.
- This system maintains market stability and guards against abrupt shifts that could trigger unwanted liquidations or invalid order executions.

By coordinating through consensus and applying strict criteria, the dYdX Chain ensures reliable and secure oracle pricing.
