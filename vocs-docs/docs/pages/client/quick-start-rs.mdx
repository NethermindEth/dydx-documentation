# Quick start with Rust

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and start using the `dydx` crate in your Rust project. Whether you're building a trading bot, analyzing market data, or just exploring decentralized exchanges, dydx provides a powerful and intuitive API to interact with the dYdX protocol.

Below you will create a Rust application and connect it to an exchange, just follow the steps.

## Creating a New Rust Project

Let's start our journey by creating a fresh Rust project. The Cargo tool makes this process straightforward and sets up all the necessary files for you:

```bash [cargo]
cargo new --bin dydx-bot
```

Once executed, you'll see a new directory structure with a basic `main.rs` file and a `Cargo.toml` configuration file. This is your blank canvas for building something amazing!

## Adding the `dydx` Dependency

Now that we have our project skeleton, let's add the `dydx` crate to our toolkit. Open your `Cargo.toml` file and add the dependency:

```toml [Cargo.toml]
[dependencies]
dydx = "0.2.0"  # Replace with the latest version // [!code ++]
```

This tells Cargo to fetch and compile the `dydx` crate the next time you build your project. The Rust package manager will handle all the dependencies automatically, saving you from dependency headaches.

:::tip
The crate being used fully supports `async` and can be used together with the [tokio](https://tokio.rs) asynchronous runtime.

You can also use the `cargo add` command if you have [cargo-edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit) installed, which will immediately add the most current version of the crate:

```bash [cargo]
cargo add dydx
```
